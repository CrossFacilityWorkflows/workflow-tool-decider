    description: >
      GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers. 
      A job can be a single command or a small script that has to be run for each of the lines 
      in the input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a 
      list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that reads from a pipe. GNU 
      parallel can then split the input and pipe it into commands in parallel.

    description: >
      TaskFarmer is a workflow manager developed in-house at NERSC to coordinate single or 
      multicore tasks. It tracks which tasks have completed successfully, and allows 
      straightforward re-submission of failed or un-run jobs from a task list.

    description: >
      The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable 
      data analyses. Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language. 
      They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without 
      the need to modify the workflow definition. Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a 
      description of required software, which will be automatically deployed to any execution 
      environment.
